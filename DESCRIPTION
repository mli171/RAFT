Description: This R pacakge provides tools for R-estimation in linear models with right-censored outcomes, extending classical rank-based R-estimators to seetings where the response is subject to censoring. The goal is to enable robust, rank-based estimation of regression effects without relying on fully parametric assumptions for the error distribution, while properly accounting for censoring.
